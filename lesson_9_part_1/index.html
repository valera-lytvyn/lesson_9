              his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten
              or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
              clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along
              with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
              bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
              moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.

              The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most
              reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please
              the buffaloes to get out of the way.
              Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers
              upon them.

              "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were
              not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And
              here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
